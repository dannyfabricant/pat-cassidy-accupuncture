In private practice since 2001, Pat has been successful in treating a wide range of health concerns. These include musculoskeletal pain, cancer support, gastrointestinal issues, women’s health, labor and post-partum support, stress-related anxiety and many other problems.

Pat holds a master’s degree in Traditional Oriental Medicine from the Pacific College of Oriental Medicine. She is licensed by the State of New York, and nationally board certified in Oriental Medicine by the NCCAOM. Abdominal acupuncture, herbs, cupping, trigger point release, cranial sacral work and lifestyle and dietary counseling are some of the services offered in her practice.

In addition to her private practice, Pat worked as an acupuncturist in a rehab facility for mentally ill substance abusers for seven years after graduation. And in the past seven years she has volunteered at Lutheran Medical Center where she trained in obstetrics, and worked on a study which evaluated the use of acupuncture during labor to reduce the c-section rate. She also assisted in the Neurological/Orthopedic/Rehabilitation department in the development of a manual for acupuncturists on the treatment of stroke patients.

Pat is committed to expanding her skill set in an effort to help patients achieve their optimal health. She completed a Graduate Mentorship Program, and is currently enrolled in coursework at the Osteopathic College of Ontario, which includes cranial-sacral and visceral manipulation techniques.

She has studied qi gong and has practiced yoga for her whole adult life.  Raising two boys has also greatly influenced her practice. She believes that mental-emotional balance plays a key role in most physical ailments and uses various techniques to help facilitate the patient’s own healing process.
